                    The sun or sol, is the star at the centre of our solar system that responsible for the earth's climate and wether</p>
                <p>The sun is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of jupiter diameter between the poles and the equator. the avarage radius of the sun is 699 (109.2*that of the earth) which 20-25 is the core.</p>
                <p>If a hallow sun was filled up with spherical earths then avarage 960,000 would fit inside. on the other hand if these earths were squished inside wasted space then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. the sun's surface area is round 10 times that of the earth's</p>
