                <p class="intro"> 
                    The jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest of the Solar system</p>
                <p>The jupiter is the oldest planet of the solar system thus it was the first to take shape out of the remain of the solar nebula.</p>
                <p>it is the fourth brightest object in the sky, jupiter was observed since ancient times and thus no one can be credited for its discovery. however the first telescopic observations were conducted by Galilei in 1609 and in 1610 Galileo also discovered the major moons of jupiter but of course not the smaller ones</p>
