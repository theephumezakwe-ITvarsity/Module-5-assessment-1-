                <p class="intro"> 
                    Neptune is a truly fascination world but as it is there is much that people don't know about it.Perheps it is because neptune is the most distant planet from our sun, or because so few exploratory missions have ventured that far out into our Solar System.</p>
                <p>Neptune is smaller than all the gas giants in the SolarSystem:jupiter,Saturn and Uranus but here's the funny thing: neptune is actually more massive than uranus by about 18%.</p>
                <p>Since it's smaller but more massive,Neptune has a much higher density than Uranus. In fact, at 1.638g/cm3 neptune is the densest gas giant in the Solar System</p>
